      <h3>Learning Coding, Need or passion?</h3>
    <p id="intro">Once i moved abroad, i noticed that English is not a big deal "as i was thinking" as all people here speaking english fluently beside thier main profession.<br>
      Well, English is my profession, as i had gradueted from English department since 2007 & worked in relative fields as Translator, Secretary and Administrative assistant, everything was just how i planned it that time.<br>
      <em>However</em>, since that time i did not add any skill to my profile, i were just working and working, and it was really bad to notice that after all this time.<br>
      So that was the point when i decided to make use of the time & invest in new skills, as <strong>time is all what i have now</strong>.<br>
      
      Therefore, i thought i have to learn something new beside learning Dutch that could be a good add to my profile and as i already had the passion to learn coding so it is <strong>"now or never"</strong>.</p>
      
    <br>
    <h4>Where to start? and will i keep learning?</h4>
    <p> I had to make learning a habit and to gain and keep a habit, i need to do it fequently, in short time & daily, so here is where i started:</p>
      <ul>
      <li class="educational-website"><a href="#youtube">YouTube</a></li>
      <li class="educational-website"><a href="#sololearn">SoloLearn</a></li>
      <li class="educational-website"><a href="#codecademy">Codecademy</a></li>
      <li class="educational-website"><a href="#khanacademy">Khanacademy</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>What i have learned from each above mentioned websites?</h4>
    <br>
    <div id="youtube">
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">
      <img src="https://marketpedia.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/youtube.png" alt="youtube logo" width="300px" height="100px"></a>
    <p>Searching for other people who where in my position and learned coding by themselves, how they started? what did they do? what is coding? what they can do after learning coding?<br>
      I found the answers of all these questions on YouTube videos, Moreover, i found videos to teach coding from zero for beginners so i just watched many related videos trying to figure out what shall i do next, till i discovered SoloLearn application.
    </p>
    </div>
    <br>
   <div id="sololearn">
   <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://eversostemley.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/sololearn1.png?w=662" alt="SoloLearn logo" width="300px" height="100px"></a>
    <p>SoloLearn was great begining for me as it is teaching coding in very simple way and on the go, i did not need any previous knowledge of coding to start learning HTML on SoloLearn, every thing was so clear and easy specially that after each lesson there is question to make sure that i got the idea and the whole program covered all the fundamentals of html plus i got a cretificate after finishing the course which just put me in a mode of acheivement and motivated me to keep learning.<br>
     After finishing HTML in few days i started with CSS and finish it also in few days, at that time i felt i have a bigger idea of what i should learn and how, so i kept searching for more sources and materials till i found Codecademy.
    </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="codecademy">
    <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank"><img src="http://blogs.flexisaf.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/logo_codecademy.png" alt="codecademy logo" width="300px" height="90px"></a>
    <p>Once i started using Codecademy i noticed it is more practical which encouraged me to take Web Development path so i strated over with HTML and CSS but this time i was more familiar with the concept and much excited to learn more and more.<br>
      Nevertheless, i think the intensive programs they offer are more practical so i think i should subscribe in web developement intensive program which come with a certificate of acheivement.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="khanacademy">
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">

    <p>Signs are just miracles to show you the right path to follow and my sign was watching the announcement of the program of <a href="https://www.hackyourfuture.net/" target="_blank">Hack your future</a>, just in time, i contacted them and got the test assignment on Khan academy, since i started working on the assignment i liked the way of presenting the lessons which similiar to codecademy yet more easier.<br>
      Moreover, i have noticed further courses to study after finishing the assignment which will keep me on the track, or maybe i will win the oopportunity to take the program of Hack your future.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <p id="footer"><strong> Final word</strong> : I feel like i need to go through the courses i studied so far again because every time i come up with new concept about HTML & CSS, for now, i just had to make sure to finish before the deadline date, but difinitly i will, i am just afraid to be in a circle of those two cources and cannot come out, so i really need you for study plan, so i will not keep it casually.<br> Thank you for this challenge which i really enjoyed, hopefully to meet the minimum requirements to join the course. </p>
